The appointments can be of 3 types: Blood Test - 15 mins, Consultation - 30 mins, Surgery - 60 mins.\n    - The booking of an appointment will not be possible if another appointment is already booked at the same time frame. An email is sent to the patient with the confirmation of the appointment.\n    - Example: Action 1: User Mike will create a blood test booking for Doctor Ana for the 4th of September starting with 15:30 PM \u2192 Possible. Action 2: User Mike will create an intervention booking for Doctor Ana for the 4th of September starting with 15:00 PM \u2192 Not Possible.
