The nurses use the system to keep track of the results of each visit including diagnosis and medications. For each visit, free form text fields are used captures information on diagnosis and treatment. Multiple medications may be prescribed during each visit. The nurses can also access the information to print out a history of patient visits. The doctors primarily use the system to view patient history. The doctors may enter some patient treatment information and prescriptions occasionally, but most frequently they let the nurses enter this information. -- Each patient is assigned to a family.

After some research, they came up with the following requirements:\n    - OOBank has many branches, each of which has an address and branch number. A client opens accounts at a branch.\n    - Each account is uniquely identified by an account number; it has a balance and a credit or overdraft limit.\n    - There are many types of accounts, including: a mortgage account (which has a property as collateral), a checking account, and a credit card account (which has an expiry date and can have secondary cards attached to it).\n    - It is possible to have a joint account (e.g. for a husband and wife).\n    - Each type of account has a particular interest rate, a monthly fee and a specific set of privileges (e.g. ability to write checks, insurance for purchases etc.).\n    - OOBank is divided into divisions and subdivisions (such as Planning, Investments and Consumer); the branches are considered subdivisions of the Consumer Division.\n    - Each division has a manager and a set of other employees.\n    - Each customer is assigned a particular employee as his or her 'personal banker'.",

After some research, they came up with the following requirements:\n    - A basic contract has a contract number (of type int) and a balance (of type double), but no monthly charges. The contract number is not automatically generated, but is to be set as a parameter by the constructor as well as the initial balance. The balance has a getter and a setter.\n    - The following options can be added to a contract (if needed also several times): 100 MB of data (monthly charge 1.00\u20ac), 50 SMS (monthly charge 0.50\u20ac), 50 minutes (monthly charge 1.50\u20ac), Double Transfer Rate (monthly charge 2.00\u20ac).\n    - Implement this requirement with the help of the decorator pattern. All contract elements should be able to understand the methods getCharges():double, getBalance():double and setBalance(double).\n    - The method getCharges() should provide the monthly charge of a contract with all its options selected. The methods getBalance() and setBalance() should be passed through and access the basic contract.",
